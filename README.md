# BloodBankManager

This application is similar to one that a blood bank would use to manage the data of their blood donors and packet recipients.
It is capable of adding/removing donors from a database, handing out blood packets to patients, and knowing how many
blood packets are available to use.

Developing this application has taught me a great deal about the overall architecture of .NET applications, database management, and
project scalability.
