# BloodBankManager

.NET Learning project.

This application is, hopefully, similar to one that a blood bank would use to manage relevant aspects of their donors and recipients.
It is capable of adding/removing donors from a database, handing out blood packets to patients, and knowing how many
blood packets are available to use.

Developing this application has taught me a great deal about the overall architecture of .NET applications, database management, and
scalability.
